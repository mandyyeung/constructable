# constructable ([demo](http://constructable.herokuapp.com))

a construction management tool to handle RFIs (Requests for Information). It is also a "for-fun" project, made with Rails 4, PostgreSQL, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, and lots of &hearts;. File uploads are handled with the Filepicker.io API, and user seed data was generated with the help of Random Users API.

Current features include an analytics dashboard, a team activity stream, user permission levels (i.e. only design team members can provide an RFI response), import/export via CSV, and flexible search/sort functions.
